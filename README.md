# Web_Log_Analysis
A website access log is a log generated when a user accesses a website server. It contains various original information and generally ends with .log. Through it, you can clearly know the user's IP, access time, request link, request status, request bytes, source link, user operating system, browser kernel, browser name, browser version and other information. The analysis and statistics of the website logs can enable us to understand some of the current status of the website, and provide a basis for various optimizations and upgrades of the website and even the company's marketing strategy.
